# Honeypot-API
An abstraction library for interacting with Honeypot

This project does not build without [Honeypot](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot), however it's been split into its own submodule for independent updates. I may allow it to build on its own in the future. If you would like to contribute, feel free to pull this repo. However, if you are wanting to build it, you may want to pull the Honeypot repo and work on the submodule there.
