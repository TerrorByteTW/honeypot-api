# HEY THERE
Starting with Honeypot 3.0.0, this API is unnecessary and will not be updated. The API itself is bundled within the `honeypot-core` package. Just change your maven dependency from `honeypot-api` to `honeypot-core`, no code changes required! Isn't that neat? :)

# Honeypot-API
An abstraction library for interacting with Honeypot

This project does not build without [Honeypot](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot), however it's been split into its own submodule for independent updates. I may allow it to build on its own in the future. If you would like to contribute, feel free to pull this repo. However, if you are wanting to build it, you may want to pull the Honeypot repo and work on the submodule there.
